# Hello and welcome to my GeoGuessr database project!

I'm planning to create an interactive dashboard with the data I scrape from the web as a beginner's guide to distinguishing different countries in [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/).

This will ideally include information such as:
- The coverage level in this country. E.g., are a large proportion of roads covered (USA), or is there only tripod coverage (China)?
- Driving side
- Road lines
- Possible bollards
- Top-level web domain
- Language(s)
- Unique characters or ways to distinguish the language from others
- The flag!

Data Sources (so far):
- [DataHub](https://datahub.io/core/country-list/r/data.csv): Country name and ISO2 for easy mapping
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-_and_left-hand_traffic): Right and left hand traffic data
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code_top-level_domain): Top-level domain
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Street_View_coverage#Current_coverage): Street view coverage
